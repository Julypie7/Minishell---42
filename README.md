# Comon Core 42 - Minishell
Minishell is first group project in common core, which we've made with [Marta](https://github.com/martucs). It requires students to develop a simple clone of Bash.  From these two statements, we can easily identify the main challenges and goals of the task:

- Acquire a deep understanding of Bash inner workings.
+ Learn how lexical and syntactic analysis works, which is indispensable also for compilers, interpreters, and programming languages.
* Coordinate work with your teammate.

The biggest challenge of project was not to get scarry of its size. We used the road map we found in the web, which helped us to navigate throughout the whole project.

In the end it took us 3 months to create and adjust our bash. And it's been a big adventure
